hello
This file will contain some text.
Here is a list.
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
4. I have resolved the conflict between the two branches.  This item is now becoming a large sequence of characters.  These characters may have meaning to some, perhaps those who speak the English language; however, in reality, they hold virtually no importance, as long as they are different from what they were before.  These characters will make it possible to detect a conflict.
5. Item 5

There are many more items that I could create, but I won't for now.

This is not a real java class, it's really just a fake one.  

Oooh, pretty colors.

And now I want to add a bunch more lines that actually don't conflict with anyone.
And one more such line.  Ooh, life without conflicts is good!
